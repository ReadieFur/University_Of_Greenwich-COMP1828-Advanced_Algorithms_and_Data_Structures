### Team mebers:
- Tristan Read (ID: `001151378`)

## Justification of the choice of the data structures and algorithms
###### (max 1 page) [10 marks]
`Summary` Go over my use of OOP design as well as the use of dictionaries (used for the speed of hashing, saves on array popping and key duplication).

## Critical evaluation of the performance of the data structures and algorithms used
###### (max 2 pages) [20 marks]
`TODO` Benchmark methods.

## Discussion for the choice of test data you provide and a table detailing the tests performed
###### (max 2 pages) [10 marks]
`Summary` Discuss my JSON data structure and why I choose it.

## Screen-captured demonstration of your working source code
###### (max 3 pages) [20 marks]

## Outcomes of Task 1, 2 and 3
###### (max 2 pages) [20 marks]

## Conclusion and critical discussion on the limitation of the work done
